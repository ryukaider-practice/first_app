GIT:

initialize a new repository:
$ git init

ignore file in version control:
.gitignore file

add files to Git (adds recursively from current directory):
$ git add .

display changes added but not yet committed:
$ git status

commit changes (saves locally, unlike subversion):
-a can be used to add and commit (don't use if you created a new file since the last commit)
$ git commit -m "message"

list of commit messages:
$ git log

checkout locally committed repository:
adding -f forces overwriting current changes
$ git checkout -f

This command tells Git that you want to add GitHub as the origin for your main (master) branch:
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:Ryukaider/scottville.git

push your repository up to GitHub:
$ git push -u origin master

create a new branch and switch to it:
$ git checkout -b <branch-name>

list all local branches (asterisk indicates current branch):
$ git branch

same as linux mv command:
$ git mv

switch to master branch:
$ git checkout master

merge branch into master branch:
$ git merge <branch-name>

delete a branch after a merge:
$ git branch -d <branch-name>

delete a branch without merging (if you screwed up the branch really bad):
$ git branch -D <branch-name>

pushes local master branch to the remote repository:
$ git push
